title: Maritime Information Sharing Environment
---

## Use Cases

The MISE defines a low cost, implementable solution for maritime information sharing while providing mechanisms to mitigate associated legal and policy concerns. As a participant in the MISE, data providers and consumers manage and share maritime information through common data definitions and security attributes, resulting in an internet accessible, unclassified information sharing capability.
